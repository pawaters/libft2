# libft - my own implementation of the standard C library

Libft is a project at Hive that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions.
We then had to use it for any other program in C we had to write and not rely on anything external.

I coded 63 functions, many of them taken from libc, most of them required by Hive.
I grouped them in 5 main types of functions:
- string manipulation ("str" functions)
- type identification ("is" functions)
- printing ("put" functions)
- memory manipulations ("mem" functions)
- linked list ("lst" functions)

I used this library afterwards to program an algorithm to resolve how to best fit a given set of tetriminoes within the smallest square possible (https://github.com/pawaters/fillit#fillit) for example.
